# testTodoApp
This is a todo app for auto tests demonstration purposes.
This repo contains simple Todo App based on The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp by Andrew Mead and cypress test that I have created for it. 

To run:
1. Download or clone repository
2. Run Git Bash in todo-app folder
3. Type "npm install" in Git Bash
4. Type "npm run dev-server" in Git Bash
5. Type "npm test" in new Git Bash instance (in todo-app folder as well).
OR
6. Type "npx cypress open" and run test manually in Cypress runner 

List of my features:
- mark todo as high priority
- unmark to do as high priority
- edit todo text
- show completed only todo's
- localization and IP information displayed (to demonstrate fetch polyfill and mocking)

Application was created for demonstration purposes only so please do not judge the code. 
Same goes for Cypress tests- they are not the optimal version- just to demonstrate different ways in which Cypress can help automated testing.
